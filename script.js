// name'd the function below play game as well as gave it the parameter of playerChoice. Within the function I created a const variable called computerChoice and made it equal our const variable choices that we declared on the second line. The Math.floor static method rounds any decimal down to an integer. The Math.random static method returns a floating point pseudo random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1 with equal distribution over the range of 0 to 1. Which you can then scale to your desired range. In this instance its 0 - 2 because the first index inside of the array is always 0. * 3 is Selecting the random 3 parameters in the choices array which hold rock paper and scissors.
